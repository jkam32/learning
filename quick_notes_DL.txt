Chap 1 Intro
------------
- Keras (backend using Theano / Tensorflow); by Francois Chollet
- mxnet (distributed; multi-machine learning)
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- expected outcome of the book
	- load image
	- preprocess image (for training a CNN)
	- build own implementation of CNN
	- implement popular CNN architecture (AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, SqueezeNet)
	- etc

Chap 2 What is Deep Learning?
-----------------------------
- DL \subset ML \subset AI
	- AI: automatic machine reasoning
	- ML: pattern recognition and learning from data
		- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one algorithm that specializes in pattern recognition / data learning
	
- History of NN and DL
	- 1943 			- first NN by McCulloch and Pitts - binary classifer with manual tuning of weights on inputs 
	- 1950s 		- Perceptron algorithm by Rosenblatt - automatic learning of weights - the automatic procedure is a basis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
	- 1969 			- publication by Minky and Papert - showed that Perceptron with a linear activation (regardless of depths) cannot solve a non-linear problem;
					- XOR dataset as an example (a non-linear problem); impossible to draw a straight line that separates the two types of objects
					- almost killed the research on NN
	- 1970s - 1980s - Werbos + Rumelhart + LeCun - backpropagation algorithm - enables the training of multi-layered feedforward NN
					- combined with non-linear activation functions can solve the XOR problem
					- the backprop algorithm allows the NN to learn from the mistakes
					- slow technology + lack of labelled training datasets cause NN computation of more than 2 hidden layers infeasible
					- technology advancement has made training of multiple hidden layers feasible
						- aka Deep Learning
						- multiple hidden layers enable hierachical learning
							- base layer learns simple concepts
							- higher layers learn the abstractions
						- prime example 
							- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by LeCun in recognizing hand-written digits
							- learns discrimating patterns (filters) by stacking layers on top of each other
							- base layers learns edges and cornes
							- higher layers build on top of base layers for discrimation of different digits
